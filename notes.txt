Q. What can metadata be applied to?

    - data objects
    - collections
    - resources
    - users
    
    Perhaps we allow metadata attached to them.

    - zones?
    - groups?
    - specific queries?

Q. Does it make sense to accept combinations of these entities?

    Perhaps data objects and collections, but not any of the entities.

    One could argue that data objects and collections shouldn't be allowed to
    mix either.

Q. Should metadata be attachable to the following?

    - Rules
    - Microservices

    Terrell: Doesn't make a lot of sense.

Q. Should table aliases get links to other tables just like their non-alias forms?
   For example, we have R_DATA_MAIN and R_DATA_MAIN_META. Should R_DATA_MAIN_META be
   joinable to R_USER_MAIN because R_DATA_MAIN is joinable to R_USER_MAIN?

Other Ideas:

- Cache GenQuery to SQL translation results.
- When handling a single column query, there is no need to go through parser.
